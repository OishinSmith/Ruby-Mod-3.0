# Ruby-Mod-3.0
Version 3.0 for the Ruby-Mod, will include a README file to explain the changes in source code as well as a Description of the contents of the Mod.

# Changes
This is Ruby-Mod 3.0, I added extra items into the mod as well as changing the Ruby Blocks them selves eg. They now glow 
slightly and allow light to pass through them

```
    setSoundType(SoundType.METAL);
    
		setHardness(3.0f);
		
		setResistance(15.0f);
		
		setHarvestLevel("pickaxe", 3);
		
		setLightLevel(1.0f);
```

It was also interesting to add a new class into the Mod which uses inheritance to allow the Ruby_Block in the folder "ModBlocks" to
inherit specific traits.
